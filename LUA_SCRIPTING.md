# LUA Scripting Migration

## Implementation Status

**Phase 1: COMPLETED ✅**  
**Phase 2: COMPLETED ✅**  
**Phase 3: COMPLETED ✅**  

### Legacy System (Being Replaced)

There is an ad hoc command system at `state.rs` that executes text-based commands with basic string interpolation from current record using placeholders like `{{line}}`, `{{lineqs}}`, and field names from parsed records.

The legacy command system was used for:
1. **Keybindings**: Defined in `settings.yaml` under the `keybindings` section, mapping keys to command strings
2. **Command mode**: Users can enter command mode and execute the same commands interactively

Legacy command processing flow:
- Commands are parsed using `sh_style_split()` for shell-like argument parsing
- String interpolation via `placeholder_render()` replaces `{{key}}` with record field values
- Commands are matched against hardcoded strings in `handle_one_command_line()`
- Each command has fixed parameters and basic string/numeric argument parsing

### New Lua System (Current Implementation)

The system now supports **both** legacy commands (as fallback) and modern Lua scripting:

**Lua Integration Status:**
- ✅ mlua 0.11 integration with Lua 5.4
- ✅ Bytecode compilation and caching 
- ✅ Enhanced error reporting with stack traces
- ✅ Full application state exposure (`app` table)
- ✅ Complete record data access (`current` table)
- ✅ All legacy commands available as Lua functions
- ✅ External `.lua` file support
- ✅ Hot-reload capability (structure in place)
- ✅ Script management and performance optimization
- ✅ Async coroutine support with yield/resume mechanism
- ✅ Interactive `ask()` function for user input during script execution
- ✅ Lazy-loaded record data access for performance optimization

## LUA Scripting Migration

We want to migrate this system to use LUA scripting via **mlua** (a high-level Lua bindings for Rust).

### Goals

1. **Replace text commands with Lua scripts**: All keybindings and commands become Lua code
2. **Pre-compilation**: Lua scripts are compiled at program startup for performance
3. **Proper variable access**: Replace string interpolation with native Lua variables
4. **Async execution**: Support yielding/resuming for long-running operations
5. **Interactive prompts**: New `ask()` function for user input during script execution
6. **Enhanced functionality**: More powerful scripting capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility

### Architecture Changes

#### 1. Lua Runtime Integration
- Integrate mlua as the scripting engine
- Create a global Lua state that persists throughout the application lifetime
- Expose application state and functions to Lua scripts

**Tests:** LUA001, LUA002, LUA003

#### 2. Script Compilation
- At startup, compile all keybinding scripts to bytecode
- Cache compiled scripts for performance
- Support both inline scripts and external `.lua` files

**Tests:** LUA004, LUA005, LUA006

#### 3. Execution Context
- Provide current record data as Lua variables (not string templates)
- Expose application state (position, mode, records, etc.)
- Make all current commands available as Lua functions
- Remove old style scripts. Only leave LUA scripts and keybindings.

**Tests:** LUA007, LUA008, LUA009

#### 4. Async Support
- Scripts can yield execution using `coroutine.yield()`
- Maintain script state for resumption
- Support pausing scripts that need user input

**Tests:** LUA010, LUA011, LUA012

#### 5. Enhanced API
- All existing commands become Lua functions: `quit()`, `vmove(n)`, `toggle_mark(color)`, etc.
- New `ask(prompt)` function that yields and waits for user input
- Access to record fields: `current.line`, `current.timestamp`, etc.
- Application state access: `app.position`, `app.mode`, etc.

**Tests:** LUA013, LUA014, LUA015, LUA016, LUA017, LUA018, LUA019, LUA020

### Example Transformations

#### Current (YAML + String interpolation):
```yaml
keybindings:
  "=": "warning {{line_number}}"
  "control-c": |
    exec wl-copy "{{line}}" || echo "{{line}}" | xclip -i -selection clipboard
    warning "Line copied to clipboard"
```

#### New (Lua scripts):
```yaml
keybindings:
  "=": "warning('Line: ' .. app.position)"
  "control-c": |
    local success = exec('wl-copy "' .. current.line .. '"') or
                   exec('echo "' .. current.line .. '" | xclip -i -selection clipboard')
    if success then
      warning("Line copied to clipboard")
    else
      warning("Failed to copy to clipboard")
    end
```

#### Interactive Script Example:
```lua
local action = ask("What do you want to do with this log line? (copy/search/open)")
if action == "copy" then
    exec('wl-copy "' .. current.line .. '"')
    warning("Copied to clipboard")
elseif action == "search" then
    local query = ask("Search query:")
    search(query)
elseif action == "open" then
    exec('xdg-open "https://google.com/search?q=' .. url_encode(current.line) .. '"')
end
```

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies
- `mlua` version 0.11 - High-level Lua bindings for Rust with lua54 and vendored features
- `log` version 0.4 - Enhanced logging for debugging and monitoring

### Modified Files
- `Cargo.toml` - Add Lua VM dependency

- `src/keyboard_management.rs` - Update keybinding execution
- `settings.yaml` - Convert to Lua scripts
- New: `src/lua_engine.rs` - Core Lua integration

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Full backward compatibility implemented**: The system now supports both legacy text commands and modern Lua scripts through a fallback mechanism:

1. **Lua First**: Commands are first attempted as Lua script execution
2. **Legacy Fallback**: If Lua execution fails, the system falls back to legacy command processing
3. **Seamless Migration**: Users can migrate incrementally from text commands to Lua scripts
4. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing keybindings and commands continue to work

This dual-mode approach allows for gradual migration while maintaining full functionality.
