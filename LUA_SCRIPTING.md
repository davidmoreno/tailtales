## Implementation Status

**Phase 1: COMPLETED âœ…**  
**Phase 2: COMPLETED âœ…**  
**Phase 3: COMPLETED âœ…**  
**Phase 4: COMPLETED âœ…**  
**Phase 5: COMPLETED âœ…**

**ðŸŽ‰ FULL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE! Pure Lua scripting system operational. ðŸŽ‰**

### Legacy System (Being Replaced)

There is an ad hoc command system at `state.rs` that executes text-based commands with basic string interpolation from current record using placeholders like `{{line}}`, `{{lineqs}}`, and field names from parsed records.

The legacy command system was used for:

1. **Keybindings**: Defined in `settings.yaml` under the `keybindings` section, mapping keys to command strings
2. **Command mode**: Users can enter command mode and execute the same commands interactively

Legacy command processing flow:

- Commands are parsed using `sh_style_split()` for shell-like argument parsing
- String interpolation via `placeholder_render()` replaces `{{key}}` with record field values
- Commands are matched against hardcoded strings in `handle_one_command_line()`
- Each command has fixed parameters and basic string/numeric argument parsing

### New Lua System (Current Implementation)

The system now supports **both** legacy commands (as fallback) and modern Lua scripting:

**Lua Integration Status:**

- âœ… mlua 0.11 integration with Lua 5.4
- âœ… Bytecode compilation and caching
- âœ… Enhanced error reporting with stack traces
- âœ… Full application state exposure (via getter functions)
- âœ… Complete record data access (via `get_record()` function)
- âœ… All legacy commands available as Lua functions
- âœ… External `.lua` file support
- âœ… Hot-reload capability (structure in place)
- âœ… Script management and performance optimization
- âœ… Async coroutine support with yield/resume mechanism
- âœ… Interactive `ask()` function for user input during script execution
- âœ… On-demand record data access via getter functions for performance optimization

## LUA Scripting Migration

We want to migrate this system to use LUA scripting via **mlua** (a high-level Lua bindings for Rust).

### Goals

1. **Replace text commands with Lua scripts**: All keybindings and commands become Lua code
2. **Pre-compilation**: Lua scripts are compiled at program startup for performance
3. **Proper variable access**: Replace string interpolation with native Lua variables
4. **Async execution**: Support yielding/resuming for long-running operations
5. **Interactive prompts**: New `ask()` function for user input during script execution
6. **Enhanced functionality**: More powerful scripting capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility

### Architecture Changes

#### 1. Lua Runtime Integration

- Integrate mlua as the scripting engine
- Create a global Lua state that persists throughout the application lifetime
- Expose application state and functions to Lua scripts

**Tests:** LUA001, LUA002, LUA003

#### 2. Script Compilation

- At startup, compile all keybinding scripts to bytecode
- Cache compiled scripts for performance
- Support both inline scripts and external `.lua` files

**Tests:** LUA004, LUA005, LUA006

#### 3. Execution Context

- Provide current record data as Lua variables (not string templates)
- Expose application state (position, mode, records, etc.)
- Make all current commands available as Lua functions
- Remove old style scripts. Only leave LUA scripts and keybindings.

**Tests:** LUA007, LUA008, LUA009

#### 4. Async Support

- Scripts can yield execution using `coroutine.yield()`
- Maintain script state for resumption
- Support pausing scripts that need user input

**Tests:** LUA010, LUA011, LUA012

#### 5. Enhanced API

- All existing commands become Lua functions: `quit()`, `vmove(n)`, `toggle_mark(color)`, etc.
- New `ask(prompt)` function that yields and waits for user input
- Access to record fields: `get_record().line`, `get_record().timestamp`, etc.
- Application state access: `get_position()`, `get_mode()`, etc.

**Tests:** LUA013, LUA014, LUA015, LUA016, LUA017, LUA018, LUA019, LUA020

### Example Transformations

#### Current (YAML + String interpolation):

```yaml
keybindings:
  "=": "warning {{line_number}}"
  "control-c": |
    exec wl-copy "{{line}}" || echo "{{line}}" | xclip -i -selection clipboard
    warning "Line copied to clipboard"
```

#### New (Lua scripts):

```yaml
keybindings:
  "=": "warning('Line: ' .. get_position())"
  "control-c": |
    local record = get_record()
    local success = exec('wl-copy "' .. record.line .. '"') or
                   exec('echo "' .. record.line .. '" | xclip -i -selection clipboard')
    if success then
      warning("Line copied to clipboard")
    else
      warning("Failed to copy to clipboard")
    end
```

#### Interactive Script Example:

```lua
local action = ask("What do you want to do with this log line? (copy/search/open)")
if action == "copy" then
    local record = get_record()
    exec('wl-copy "' .. record.line .. '"')
    warning("Copied to clipboard")
elseif action == "search" then
    local query = ask("Search query:")
    search(query)
elseif action == "open" then
    local record = get_record()
    exec('xdg-open "https://google.com/search?q=' .. url_encode(record.line) .. '"')
end
```

2. **No Fallback**: The old text-based command system has been completely removed
3. **Clean Architecture**: Simplified codebase with single execution path
4. **Enhanced Functionality**: Full access to Lua programming capabilities

All existing keybindings have been converted to equivalent Lua scripts in the default settings.yaml file.

## Implementation Summary

**Phase 1 & 2 Complete**: The Lua scripting system is fully implemented and tested with comprehensive functionality:

### âœ… Completed Features

- **Lua Runtime**: mlua 0.11 integration with Lua 5.4, memory management, and lifecycle control
- **Script Compilation**: Bytecode caching system with performance optimization
- **External Files**: Support for `.lua` files with metadata tracking and hot-reload infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced reporting with stack traces, line numbers, and detailed context
- **API Integration**: All legacy commands available as Lua functions with proper type conversion
- **State Exposure**: Complete application state (`app`) and lazy-loaded record data (`current`) access
- **Command Processing**: Deferred command execution system with registry pattern
- **Backward Compatibility**: Fallback mechanism supporting both Lua and legacy commands
- **Async Operations**: Full coroutine support with yield/resume for interactive scripts
- **User Interaction**: `ask()` function with UI integration and proper mode management
- **Performance**: Lazy-loaded record access for optimal performance on simple operations
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all Phase 1, 2, and 3 requirements

### âœ… Phase 3 Complete Features

- **"g" Keybinding**: Jump to line number with interactive prompt using ask() functionality
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy-loaded record data access via metatable for efficient simple operations
- **State Management**: Complete suspension/resumption cycle with proper mode transitions
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and cleanup for suspended scripts

### âœ… Complete Implementation (All Phases Finished)

The Lua scripting system is now fully implemented and operational:

- **Pure Lua System**: No legacy fallback, all commands and keybindings use Lua
- **Asynchronous Input**: `ask()` function enables interactive scripts with user prompts (optimized at VM level)
- **Enhanced Navigation**: "g" key provides goto-line functionality with input validation
- **Production Ready**: All settings converted, proper error handling, comprehensive testing

#### New Interactive Features

**"g" Keybinding - Goto Line**

```lua
local line_str = ask("Go to line number:")
local line_num = tonumber(line_str)
if line_num then
  vgoto(line_num - 1)  -- Convert to 0-based indexing
  warning("Moved to line " .. line_num)
else
  warning("Invalid line number: " .. line_str)
end
```

This demonstrates the `ask()` function's capability for interactive user input during script execution.

#### Performance Optimizations

The `ask()` function is now defined once at the VM initialization level rather than being redefined for each script execution, providing significant performance improvements for scripts that use async functionality.

- **Custom User Scripts**: Plugin system for user-defined functionality
- **Complex Automation**: Multi-step workflows with conditional logic
- **External API Integration**: HTTP requests and data processing
- **Advanced Filtering**: Dynamic filters with custom logic
- **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing and live data transformation
- **User-defined Commands**: Custom command libraries and shared scripts
